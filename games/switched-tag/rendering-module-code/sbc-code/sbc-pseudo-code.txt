Define game variables

reset, 
player 1 location, player 2 location,
player 1 it value, player 2 it value, 
player 1 it status, player 2 it status, player 1 win, player 2 win, two winner ignore
collision detect signal,
pendelum signal

Setup code for when microcontroller is powering up
1. Initialize ADCs
2. Initialize values of variables

Loop

#ADC value retrieval process
3. Select ADC
4. Get value from ADC
5. Store adc value to corresponding variable
6. Repeat step 3 - 5 until all game variables initialized

#Drawing 
7. Draw player 1, bright blue if it, blue if not it
8. Draw player 2, red if it, brown if not it
9. Draw pendelum
10. Draw a flash on screen if collision happened
11. Make background more white if player 1 wins, more black if player 2 wins
