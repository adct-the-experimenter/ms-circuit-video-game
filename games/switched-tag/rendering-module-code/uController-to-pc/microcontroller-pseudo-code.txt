Define game variables

reset, 
player 1 location, player 2 location,
player 1 it value, player 2 it value, 
player 1 it status, player 2 it status, player 1 win, player 2 win, two winner ignore
collision detect signal,
pendelum signal

Setup code for when microcontroller is powering up
1. Initialize ADCs
2. Initialize values of variables

Loop

#ADC value retrieval process
3. Select ADC
4. Get value from ADC
5. Store adc value to corresponding variable
6. Repeat step 3 - 5 until all game variables initialized

#Encode values of game variables into draw instruction
7.Encode 8-bit number indicating status of world 
i.e. player 1 it status, player 2 it status, 
player 1 win, player 2 win, two winner ignore, collision detect

8. Encode 8-bit number containing player 1 it value and playe 2 it value

9. Convert pendelum signal value into 8-bit number

#Send draw instuction
10.Send draw instruction(3 8-bit numbers) to computer
