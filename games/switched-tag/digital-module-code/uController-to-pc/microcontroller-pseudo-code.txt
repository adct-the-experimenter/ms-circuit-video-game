0.Declare array buffer for storing ADC values

1.Declare and define game variables
 
player 1 location, player 2 location,
player 1 it status, player 2 it status,
collision detect signal,
pendelum signal


Loop

#ADC value retrieval process from UART
2. Read line from UART, get adc channel and value

3. Store adc value to corresponding variable

4. Repeat step 2 - 3 until all game variables initialized

#Translate values of game variables into draw instruction
5. Draw players based on location reported

6. Draw players a different color depending on it status.

7. Draw pendelum location based on value.
