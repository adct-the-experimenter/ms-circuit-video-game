Define game variables

reset, 
player 1 location, player 2 location,
player 1 it value, player 2 it value, 
player 1 it status, player 2 it status, player 1 win, player 2 win, two winner ignore
collision detect signal,
pendelum signal

Setup code for when microcontroller is powering up
1. Initialize ADCs
2. Initialize values of variables

Loop

#ADC value retrieval process
1. Select ADC
2. Get value from ADC
3. Store adc value to corresponding variable
4. Repeat step 3 - 5 until all game variables initialized
5. Filter adc data with FIR low-pass filter for more time accurate representation

#Process data
6. check if collision detection happened
7. convert voltage representing player locations to a pixel location for player 
8. determine state based on player it status and win

#Drawing 
9. Draw player 1, light blue if it, blue if not it
10. Draw player 2, red if it, brown if not it
11. Draw pendelum
12. Draw a flash on screen if collision happened
13. Make background more white if player 1 wins, more black if player 2 wins
