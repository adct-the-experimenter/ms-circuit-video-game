# Mixed-Signal Circuit Video Games

## Move to new location: https://gitlab.com/pab44/ms-circuit-video-game

This is an ambitious project that will make a video game system from a hybrid computing approach.

The change was made from analog logic only to hybrid computing in order to give more options to developers.
 
The bidirectional communication between digital & hybrid controller module and analog module 
allows for 4 options: analog logic & digital rendering; parallel computation between analog module and 
digital module; analog computation as part of digital computation; analog and digital module used for 
partial computation for a personal computer. 

Includes collection of test circuits.

op-amp modeled in these circuits is LM358A.


#### The game circuits still need development. There is not a video signal output or audio signal output to the TV display yet.
