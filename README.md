# Mixed-Signal Circuit Video Games

This is an ambitious project that will make a video game with analog circuit logic 
and digital rendering.

Includes collection of test circuits.

Output of analog circuit block will be some signals representing position of characters and other things.

Digital rendering module will take a snapshot of these signal representations to draw a visual and aural 
representation of the game world.

#### The game circuits still need development. There is not a video signal output or audio signal output to the TV display yet.
