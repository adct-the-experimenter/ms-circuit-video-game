# General Project Requirements

These are project requirements that are recommended for any game project
made based on this open-source project.

## Values provided to the user
- Video games that are able to be preserved through maintenance and repair of the circuitry
of the game system. 
- Modifiable games i.e. graphics, sound, and game logic can be modified by hardware or code.

## Requirements derived from values provided

### Circuit
- A functioning circuit schematic design validated by circuit simulation and/or models.
- Jumpers to allow hardware modification of the logic, graphics, sound of the game.

### PCB Design 
- Printed circuit board must be EMC (ELectromagnetic compatibility) compliant.
- SMD jumpers to allow hardware modification of the logic, graphics, sound of the game.
- Test points for easy debug.

### Enclosure Form Factor
- Leave enough space for printed circuit board to fit.
- Make slots for the connectors for controllers and modifiable jumpers.
